# Contributing

Do you want to contribute to the project? **Learn how to do so, below.**

Take a moment to read the guidelines in order to ensure smooth issue-tracking and bug-fixing experience for everyone.
<br>
You will have to use the appropriate tags to address problems with the project. 
<br>
And as always, provide the steps to accurately reproduce the issue.

## Labels for Issues
I utilise 5 different labels that all represent different things.
<br>
Make sure to post in the appropriate label to avoid confusion.

* `bug` - Here you can post everything related to bugs found in the project.
* `question` - If you have any kind of question that has nothing to do with **bugs** and **help** then post here.
* `help wanted` - Do you need any help expanding this project? Use this label.
* `suggestions` - If you have any suggestion to make, this is the place to do so.
* `duplicate` - All duplicates belong to this label.
